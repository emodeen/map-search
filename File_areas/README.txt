MapFile is a program that finds the largest area in a graph.  
An area is defined as the number of adjacent "." characters that are bounded by "X" characters.

To run the program, run the class com.emodeen.MapFile, passing the path to the map file as a parameter.  
For example, you could run “java MapFile C:\Users\mapfile.txt”.  A sample map file is included in the project.
